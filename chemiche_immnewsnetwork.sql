(1, 'Linn Vizard', 1, 'So What Do You Do? A Designer’s Guide to Talking About Their Profession', 'It’s one thing to explain what it is you do, and another to convince people of the value of design and UX. There has been a lot of attention on this topic over recent years, with conversation around ‘proving’ the ROI (return on investment) of UX, and increased focus on measurement. At the same time, there is a sense that it’s hard to simply convince people of the value. ', 'I still remember the long bus ride to a remote, budget-airline airport in Europe where I tried to explain my UX role and work to my mum. We spent ages talking about the process, walking through each step that is involved, and looking at examples of apps on her Android phone. I even did some simple wireframe sketches on napkins to illustrate!\r\n\r\nWhy is UX design so hard to explain?\r\nThat conversation took a long time, and recently my Mum said she still occasionally has a hard time explaining what I do when people ask her. So why is it that? I recently reached out to my network of UX designers and heard perspectives from more than a dozen of them around the world on how they explain what we do for a living, and why it is that UX and design can be so hard to explain clearly and succinctly.\r\n\r\nFor many people, a lack of familiarity with the effort and intentionality that goes into creating digital products can make the work of a UX designer difficult to grasp. For example, Kat Schouten, a designer based in Waterloo, Canada says “If your audience doesn’t understand technology — it’s really hard to communicate how every part of a product is created intentionally. Some people assume that iPhones just appear out of thin air! Eventually through conversation they understand that there is a whole system behind each element of their phone, car, and computer interface.”\r\n\r\nJargon is also a huge barrier to explaining UX. Like any specialized field, we have a vast vocabulary of words that are unfamiliar and potentially meaningless to people outside of it. This is one of the reasons I have a hard time talking to some of my family members in Swedish about UX, because I have not developed the specialized vocabulary of design in my second language. “It’s hard to try not to use the words we UXers use and use the words non-designers use,” says Bertrand Lirette, design teacher, Université Laval. “One of my more successful attempts at explaining the value of UX was when I didn’t use all the UX jargon to try to explain it. I actually used the words the people I was working with understood, for example saying there will be less time wasted in a queue to checkout.”\r\n\r\nDealing with complexity and preconceived ideas of design\r\nUX is also a field that is very broad, as well as being complex. Many people mentioned the struggles of not over-simplifying, without being too ‘inside baseball’ about our profession. “I find it hard not to massively simplify it to make it easy to understand, which then undervalues the entire discipline,” explains Helen Nic Giolla Rua, a product designer based in Dublin, Ireland.  “It’s actually a big mixture of soft skills and hard skills and is incredibly valuable to a business. It also changes depending on what company you’re in and what they require.” Sori Lee, a UX Designer based in Toronto, Canada, agrees, “The UX umbrella is really broad to cover holistically when you’re trying to explain it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not making things prettier. Sometimes I’m not even designing something tangible or physical. I’m working with a business on the direction that they should be going in based on what we learn together about their customers and their current business model.” — Dan Nanasi\r\nFinally, for many of us, differentiating UX from visual design or hitting home that it’s more than ‘making things pretty’ continues to be a struggle. As someone whose visual design skills are not my strongest suit, this definitely resonates. Dan Nanasi, who works in Vancouver, Canada as a UX strategist says that the hardest thing is explaining that “I’m not making things prettier. Sometimes I’m not even designing something tangible or physical. I’m working with a business on the direction that they should be going in based on what we learn together about their customers and their current business model.” Violet Edwards, a senior UX designer in Toronto, Canada says “People think you’re a graphic designer or a “web designer”. They often don’t get the strategy and research component. Also, there are so many UX jobs (aka product design) masquerading as graphic design jobs, so even hiring managers don’t always really understand what a UX Designer is.”\r\n\r\nUnanimously, designers surveyed seem to agree that explaining what it is we do all day and get paid for is challenging, with a variety of barriers to helping people ‘get it.’ So let’s look at some strategies and approaches that designers use in various settings.\r\n\r\nThe dreaded ‘what do you do?’\r\nPicture this scene: you’re at a family event, or maybe your partner’s work holiday party as a plus one, or simply meeting someone new. At some point, the question of ‘what do you do?’ usually arises. It’s enough to make us hard-to-explain-career types get sweaty palms! In this situation, it’s important to remember that you’re dealing with a social interaction. The goal is to make a connection with people and continue the conversation, so it’s crucial not to alienate them.\r\n\r\nOne approach is to keep it very simple and straightforward, even if you feel it doesn’t really tell the full story of what UX is. This can be an easier entry point, and if the person asking displays more interest, you can go deeper. Several designers reported saying something along the lines of ‘I design websites or apps.’ Ken Kongkatong, a junior UX designer at a bank in Toronto, says “In a social setting or to non-designers, I’ll say I design websites and apps at a high-level. This description is of course counter to my ‘true’ understanding of the role.” Another person, who preferred to remain anonymous, mentioned that they say “I do web design, because it’s simpler to state it this way, and I don’t get asked too many questions. I would love to have a straightforward answer, but I don’t.”\r\n\r\nTalking about what you do for work in social settings can be anxiety inducing since UX design is hard to explain clearly.\r\nFor others, describing a familiar and relatable scenario can be helpful. “I ask people, what makes their favourite restaurant their favourite restaurant. Then I explain that good UX designers don’t focus on the food alone, they focus on the entire dining experience,” says Aprurv Ray, a senior designer. Violet mentions that she will say something like “You know when you’re on your phone or your computer (or something with a screen) and sometimes you’re like ‘argh, I give up!’? My job is to prevent that from happening,” followed by a smile. While Violet’s example focuses on the less smooth interactions, Tony Tudor, a product design director, takes the opposite approach. “I’ll say something like, ‘you know when you use an app on your phone and thank god for technology that makes things that easy? This is what I do, making apps feel like they don’t exist and they just serve you in the easiest way possible without you noticing it.”\r\n\r\nThis idea of making something easier or better for users came up repeatedly in the simple sentences people submitted as example of how they explain what they do for a living. These one liners might be a great starting point for social conversations about your work.\r\n\r\n“I help shape how people use products and services and make sure their experience is good and beneficial.” – Noah Fang, service designer & business strategist\r\n“I make sure you’re not saying the service you’re using sucks.” Bertrand Lirette, design teacher\r\n“I think about experiences of using things and how I can reduce the anxiety and effort associated with those activities and desired outcomes.” Ghislaine Guerin, designer\r\n“I tell them I make technology easy to use!” Sori Lee, UX designer\r\n“Very simply put, I make technology easier for people to interact with.” Andrea Photiou, UX/UI designer\r\nExplaining UX to colleagues and stakeholders\r\nIn contrast to primarily social interactions, in work settings there can be more riding on building an understanding of your role as a designer. Even for people who have UX designers in their organization or on their team, colleagues may not understand what that means or why it’s important. Building mutual trust, understanding, and buy-in for design work is what greases the wheels of projects for success. Designers often need to work collaboratively with subject matter experts and leaders from other departments or practice areas. When explaining what design is and what you do, it’s crucial to meet people where they are at, and frame UX design as something that is relevant to them.\r\n\r\nYour colleagues understanding your role is crucial for enabling successful collaboration.\r\n“I help people do things more efficiently, create delightful experience for users and make profits for business.” — Sori Lee\r\nFraming design as a way to drive business success can be a useful starting point. Ghislaine Guerin, a designer based near Madrid, Spain, talks to colleagues about how “good design makes for valuable products, leading to users that are engaged, happy and more likely to pay.” Sori echoes this, explaining to colleagues that “I help people do things more efficiently, create delightful experience for users and make profits for business.”\r\n\r\nAnother way to frame UX, especially in customer-focused organizations, is to talk about the benefits to the end user. For Bertrand, he tells colleagues that UX is about “putting yourself in the shoes of the user to satisfy their needs.” Michael Hodgkin, the web UX lead at the Australian Government Department of Human Services explains it to stakeholders like this, “If your users aren’t happy, you won’t be happy. You can’t make your users happy without understanding them. If you want to understand your user, design things they want, and understand if you’re succeeding, you need UX.”\r\n\r\nSome people get even more specific and articulate the ways in which UX can help people complete tasks. For example, Tony tells stakeholders, “we are here to make users interaction with the app as minimum and effective as possible. So the user will complete the task (even if it’s just browsing) without a lot of thinking, rather using only muscle memory.” Andrea Photiou, based in Michigan, says the following to people in a work context, “My job is to design technology that makes our users’ journey from point A to point B as easy, and thoughtless as possible. It’s my job to put the thought into the design, so my users don’t have to. If the desired outcome of an interaction involves a user completing a purchase, it is my job to help guide the user there and eliminate any challenges or distractions in the process.” She also points out that there is a difference between ‘pushing a sale’ and helping a user to get what they need.\r\n\r\nA further approach that emerged as a common theme was tailoring the message depending on who you are talking to. For Violet, how she explains UX really depends on who it is. “Sometimes it’s about communicating the value of spending time on discovery/research to avoid investing in the wrong decision (as development is so costly). It can also be about showing how UX is very aligned with the ‘customer-centric’ values of their mandate (e.g. Sales, Support, etc.). Either way, money talks.” This aligns with Kat’s approach in telling her colleagues that “we are here to ask ‘why’ our users are currently using our product. For the sales team, this translates into how to position and price the products. For the marketing team, it’s about how to appeal to their target demographic. And for the dev team, it means they can better understand what needs to be prioritized and developed. The meaning of why can change over time, we’re here to keep a pulse on our user behaviors so that as an organization we can be more agile.”\r\n\r\nA word on articulating the value of UX\r\nIt’s one thing to explain what it is you do, and another to convince people of the value of design and UX. There has been a lot of attention on this topic over recent years, with conversation around ‘proving’ the ROI (return on investment) of UX, and increased focus on measurement. At the same time, there is a sense that it’s hard to simply convince people of the value. Jared Spool has even written an article about this; ‘Why I can’t convince executives to invest in UX (and neither can you).’\r\n\r\nSeveral designers surveyed spoke to this as well, with the essence boiling down to ‘show don’t tell’ when it comes to the value of UX design. For Kat, “Explaining value hasn’t been as effective as showing it. After running a workshop with a local startup, it shifted their mindset. They began to understand the value of their product to their customers and how that can shift between different demographics.” Noah Fang, a service designer & business strategist echoed this sentiment, saying “I don’t think explaining the value would ever work if the listeners don’t already have the belief or haven’t experienced the process, or haven’t witnessed the results. The explanation mostly works after people saw the value by actually doing: once after a successful run, I got to explain what I did is part of the UX design expertise, and highlighted the critical moments in the process. That helped them understand the designerly way of doing by recalling those moments.”\r\n\r\nTangible examples can also be helpful. Ken mentions a time when “I had to explain to someone the value of UX for a business. I believe I did this effectively when I explained how Spotify increased their conversion rate by switching from a hamburger menu to a tab bar in their app based on the findings from their A/B Testing.” Gus Waller, a UX researcher and designer in Vancouver, Canada, shows people results from testing. “Photos, videos or quotes are a very easy way to communicate the value of UX to anyone sceptical or new to the discipline. For example, if you want proof that someone struggles to use your product, here’s a 30 second video of 12 different people struggling to log in.”\r\n\r\nFinally, at World Interaction Design Day recently, one of my fellow panelists mentioned the Jared Spool $300 million dollar button example as a great one to keep in your back pocket when faced with the value of UX question.\r\n\r\nA selection of analogies for explaining UX\r\nWhen all else fails in explaining UX, try an analogy! They can be a great tool for explaining UX in any context. Here’s a collection of some great UX analogies that people shared.\r\n\r\n“Good UX is like insurance. It’s a sensible investment that increases the likelihood of a) building the right thing, and b) the thing being successful.” – Gus Waller, UX researcher and designer\r\n“Users want their needs satisfied, business want their needs satisfied. UX lubricates that friction.” – Michael Hodgkin, web UX lead\r\n“UX is like DJing - you have to create an amazing experience using empathy, harmony, and an understanding of flow.” - Violet Edwards\r\n“It’s like DJing. Creating a great user experience is a lot like wooing a crowd on a dance floor. Both experiences are interactive and require the use of empathy, harmony, and an understanding of flow.” – Violet Edwards, senior UX designer\r\n“UX is like a technology shepherd. Leading the way and removing barriers to help get everyone to where they love to be. Keeping users safe from dangers like wasted time.” Andrea Photiou, UX/UI designer\r\n“I like to build off from Alan Cooper’s analogy of an interaction designer as an architect by suggesting that being a UX designer is analogous to being an urban designer.” – Ken Kongkatong, junior UX designer\r\nAs design evolves, so will our explanations\r\nAs Muryani Kasdani, senior user researcher and service designer puts it, “Many people don’t know that design has shifted from the traditional notion of design, meaning ‘the making of stuff’ (e.g. product design is about making products, graphic design is about making posters, etc.) to ‘designing for a purpose’ (e.g. designing for sustainability) and that design methods and approach, such as human-centered design, can be applied in many different contexts/ fields.” This makes our job of explaining what it is we do for a living challenging.\r\n\r\nThese shifts can also work in our favour, as design and technology become more visible in popular culture. Nate Archer, a user experience researcher and product strategist in Toronto, says that, “Once mobile apps became a thing around 2007, explaining how UX was a role felt way more intuitive to non-designers. This felt like a watershed moment when people understood that the design of an app varied from one to another.”\r\n\r\nEither way, the keys to talking about your work are understanding the context of the conversation, doing your best to know your audience and meet them where they are at, and showing rather than telling the value of design. Try using these principles and you’ll be well on your way.\r\n\r\nA huge thank you to everyone who contributed to the research for this piece.\r\n\r\nFor UX insights sent straight to your inbox, sign up for Adobe’s experience design newsletter!', 0, 'career1.jpg', 'https://theblog.adobe.com/16-experts-explain-ux-design-and-what-they-do/'),

What better boss is out there than yourself? There is also the promise of sleeping in and days spent wearing pajamas (at least on the bottom) that for some is irresistible. It’s not quite that simple, however. There is a real hustle involved in the freelance life and before you put in your notice, you should make sure you understand what it means to work for yourself, and the basic considerations you need to make in order to be successful.\r\n\r\nUnderstand Your Business\r\nUnderstanding the business aspects of freelancing is just as important as understanding your craft. What are the skills and services that you are providing your clients? Do you know the value of your skills and services? Bookkeeping is a necessary component that every freelancer needs to learn to survive financially. Treat freelancing like a business not a lifestyle; taking control of your financial health will allow you to to live the life you want to live.\r\n\r\nKnowing what you are offering helps in finding and and selling your services to clients. Defining a niche that you can specialize in establishes your credibility when pitching your skills, services and solutions and will give comfort in your skills helps you when working with clients.\r\n\r\nIn order to work within client budgets, establish a billing process and value for your services. Defining the value, you offer to clients can be difficult. Research existing market rates for hourly rates and fixed rate projects. Undercharging will result in having to take on more work to meet expenses, while overcharging will result in not having enough work to cover expenses. Having a flexible billing model can help you price a variety of projects (big, small, simple, complex). Learn when to use hourly rates (where you are paid for how long it takes to finish the project), a fixed rate (you will need to determine the time and possible overtime on a project) and value-add pricing (you should calculate how much value you are giving a client for solving the specific problem).\r\n\r\nThe basic principles that every freelancer should understand is invoicing and keeping track of billables and expenses. Keep records and receipts in a safe place. A simple shoe box is a start. Match receipts to the type of expense necessary to run your freelance business. Subscriptions to web services, software, workshops and computer repairs are expenses that can be overlooked come tax time.\r\n\r\nContracts\r\nContracts help protect you and the project stakeholders. Define the nature of the work, when are certain deliverables are due and who is responsible for each aspect of the project. Remember to state the cost of the project and what is and is not included in the scope of work to be done. Don’t become the de facto technical support. A contract should state what the payment terms of the project are, who owns the intellectual property (IP) and when the IP transfer will occur and when the project will be completed. Situations may be different for type of work you do.\r\n\r\nContracts should cover contingencies, quality assurance and worst case scenarios.\r\n\r\nHaving a cancellation clause is good practice and useful if the nature of the work or relationship with the client changes. Clients may “pull” a project for various reasons. A cancellation clause helps you get compensated for the work done.\r\n\r\n“Never work without a contract.”\r\n\r\nAs a freelancer, make sure to define what is considered “maintenance” (updates to a current site or project) or what is considered a new project. A simple rule to follow is that updates to content are considered maintenance, while changes to structure, adding features, functionality or page layouts are considered a new project. Adding a new element to a page may seem easy but may require whole-scale changes to interface designs, element structures and code bases, not to mention that changes may impact the existing user experience.\r\n\r\nDefine what the technical requirements of a project are. You don’t want to be caught supporting a relatively unknown browser or technology. When meeting with stakeholders, note the types of phones and browsers they are using to establish a requirements baseline.\r\n\r\nEstablish a Work/Life Balance\r\nOne of the hardest parts of freelancing is drawing a line between where the work ends and your life begins. It is very easy to turn your kitchen table into an office. Create a defined space that is your work space and keep it from encroaching on your living space. Without a defined work space, your entire living space becomes associated with work and you have no place to call your own or where you can escape reminders of work.\r\n\r\nSet guidelines for when your work day ends. Not answering client emails after a set hour can help you establish and maintain much-needed time for a personal life.\r\n\r\nLegalities and Taxes\r\nTaxes is the one subject no one likes to talk about but it plays, or should play, a major part in your business and business decisions. Before leaping into freelancing, it is best to educate yourself on the tax implications of being self-employed and running your own freelance business. Self-employment can also make it hard to secure financial services such as loans or lines of credit. Be prepared to retain and submit financial records and other paperwork for simple things like opening a bank account.\r\n\r\nUnderstand what the tax policies and legal requirements for your jurisdiction are. This may include registering a business even though you are working alone, and getting a license to run a business from your home or apartment. Remember to note the type of taxes you may be required to collect and remit when you are self-employed.\r\n\r\nLet the Hustle Begin\r\nWith the essentials in order, you might feel ready to take the plunge into becoming a full-time freelancer. But before you leave your cushy job, know that while freelancing comes with freedom and flexibility, it also involves hard work.', 0, 'career2.jpg', 'https://theblog.adobe.com/design-freelancing-101-things-to-consider-when-working-for-yourself/'),
(4, 'Andrew Smyk', 2, 'Trick or Treat? A Look At Dark UX and Its Implications on Users', 'Dark patterns leverage cognitive science in order to play out the deception. These can include using similar identifiable UI elements from well-known sites, using confusing labels or attention-grabbing links, and they can take advantage of user habits using emotive content. Some sites using dark UI will provide users with options or additional upselling that can prey on a users’ indecisiveness, insecurity, or forgetfulness.', 'There’s good UX and then there’s dark UX or anti-patterns. Far from true user-centered design principles, Dark UX or anti-patterns are used in digital products to make users sign-up and buy something unknowingly or to get a users’ personal information through trickery or misdirection. Using anti-patterns may have some initial benefits for creators and companies, however, the long-term effect is that these practices create a cloud of mistrust. Users will scrutinize pages and question their decisions, leading to fewer conversions. Some dark patterns, unlike their name, can be bright and downright obnoxious.\r\n\r\nDark patterns leverage cognitive science in order to play out the deception. These can include using similar identifiable UI elements from well-known sites, using confusing labels or attention-grabbing links, and they can take advantage of user habits using emotive content. Some sites using dark UI will provide users with options or additional upselling that can prey on a users’ indecisiveness, insecurity, or forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nRedirection/Misdirection\r\nRecently, my parents encountered a problem with their computer and while trying to fix their simple tech issue through a series of prompts, they landed on a page that looked like the anti-virus software they were running. Somewhere between looking for a solution and solving the computer problem, my parents had signed up for enterprise-level support and their credit card was charged a $750 a month subscription. Luckily, after spending several hours on the phone with the company and their bank, the charges were reversed. However, my parents are now hesitant when doing any kind of transaction on the web.\r\n\r\nHow did this happen? It happened through redirection and misdirection that all started with a simple button labeled Support versus the proper link for tech support which was further down the page.\r\n\r\nForced Continuity\r\nHow many of us have signed up for a free trial period only to find credit card charges months later? The forced continuity dark pattern requires a credit card number from a user to access a free trial. Without any notification or reminders, the user’s credit card is charged automatically. Forced continuity (free trial periods) rely on the fact that most people will forget to log in to cancel before the trial period expires. Netflix has evolved their new subscriber onboarding with a message that a reminder will be sent before the trial period ends.\r\n\r\nSimilar to forced continuity is negative option billing cycles, where the user is charged for the highest bundle or service level automatically and is required to choose a less expensive level of service. This can take the form of shopping carts that choose the most expensive means of delivering a package even though the order qualifies for free shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoach Motel\r\nThe roach motel dark pattern is one that is used to put the user into a situation that they cannot get out of easily. A common roach motel approach is to sneak something into the user’s online shopping cart at checkout. Additional inclusions in the shopping cart can be a paid subscription to an additional service or upsell. The only way to not pay for the additions is to opt out during checkout. Opt-outs will use tricky or confusing wording to add cognitive fog to the decision-making process. More often than not, users do not realize that they have purchased or authorized extras until the transaction is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the user has entered the roach motel situation, opting out and unsubscribing becomes difficult. Again, subscriptions can only be canceled within a short period of time before the next renewal date. Some services will not let a user delete or alter their credit card information or the financial information is not part of their online profile.\r\n\r\nAnother example is opting out of newsletters. Do not make the process convoluted or require a website login. Allow the user to make a choice and not have to guess their email with obfuscation, “Remove a********@g*******.com”, keep it simple.\r\n\r\nDark Patterns Don’t Pay Off in the Long Term\r\nDark patterns have emerged as a way to increase conversions in the short term but can have long-term effects on customer satisfaction and trust. Dark patterns become a numbers game rather than a means of establishing a long-term relationship with one’s user base. Don’t make users feel like they have been taken advantage of or fooled. Using usability heuristics can help guide proper design decisions and positive UX patterns for your users.\r\n\r\nFollow the #darkpattern and #darkpatterns hashtags on Twitter provides an ongoing list of dark UX examples.', 1, 'industry1.jpg', 'https://theblog.adobe.com/trick-or-treat-a-look-at-dark-ux-and-its-implications-on-users/'),
(5, 'Dan Zen', 2, 'Dan Zen on Consumption and Creation.', 'We have seen a difficult trend for independent interactive content creators: Fifteen years ago content creators were paid for creating content. Ten years ago creators were downgraded to receiving advertising money. Five years ago creators had to pay to have their content shown. Today, content creators have to pay consumers to partake in their content.', 'It’s A Consumer’s World\r\n\r\nWe have seen a difficult trend for independent interactive content creators: Fifteen years ago content creators were paid for creating content. Ten years ago creators were downgraded to receiving advertising money. Five years ago creators had to pay to have their content shown. Today, content creators have to pay consumers to partake in their content.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a generalization, but in the digital world the contemporary consumer seems to get what they want at very little cost.  They now assume that music, entertainment and information should be (and there are often ways to get it) free. This however makes it tough for creators of original content to make a living and to optimally produce content.\r\n\r\nFor instance, my own site http://danzen.com has 3 million page views. At a minute a view this is 50,000 hours of entertainment.  And yet, from dozens of different attempts at monetizing, the site has made about $500. That is a payoff of one cent an hour.\r\n\r\nThe concern, however, is not just the money — interactive content creators are often happy if people simply use their tools or experience their environments.  A far greater concern is that people are partaking less and less in independent interactive content.  “Interactivity” can be broken down into types and when referring to interactive content I mean interactivity beyond just navigation to where people can create and communicate with one another.\r\n\r\nPeople today are spending increasing amounts of their time on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Here, they share pictures, stories and videos that comprise authoritative content, but they rarely share interactive content or take the time to go out and engage in interactive experiences.  We can deduce that the attention span of people online has been greatly reduced.  They write and read in 140 characters. The status post is the new blog. They are no longer accustomed to spending time reading a story, let alone creating a story.\r\n\r\nAlongside social media usage, people are increasingly partaking in online gaming.  For the most part, gaming is consumption of thrill and is not really creation.  Puzzles have the mindset of creation and they hone the mind of the user but the output does not benefit society.  Creation via programming also hones the mind, and has the added benefit that the output usually helps society: it educates or entertains and can provide environments to communicate or organize.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, today there is more creative practice executed in a day than in all of history up to 1950.  Millions of songs, art pieces, stories and the like are being made on a daily basis. Proportionally, though, I think less people create. This is probably because there is just so much to consume and to consume is so much easier. Also, creative renaissances come and go, just like any other trend. Those trends may also differ in different regions.  I would not say that in North America it is currently “popular” to create although the Maker movement is gaining traction.\r\n\r\nCreation and Mobility\r\n\r\nA recent factor in the creation versus consumption balance has been the onset of mobile devices.  Smaller mobile screens and somewhat reduced controls can limit creative production.  For instance, graphic designers use many panels in an application such as Photoshop and require precise selections that would be hard to achieve on a mobile device. Even if the interfaces improve, there is often distraction when being mobile, especially in busy areas, and so surely this is not the correct platform for true creativity. Even so, workstations, the ideal site for focused creativity, are being abandoned for mobile devices.\r\n\r\n[There are of course new ways to create using mobile – and we can improve on some of the old ways!]\r\n\r\nNaming Interactivity\r\n\r\nPeople gravitate towards things they are comfortable with. The Internet is a new medium – even more so a medium of mediums – and yet the majority just use it to consume articles, listen to music, view pictures, watch videos and play games. These mediums are easily recognized with single established names and the user has clear expectations before partaking.\r\n\r\nWe do not have a name for a digital interactive feature. We may call it a tool or an application, but this is far from suiting all interactive features.  Could we call it an environment or medium instead?  Perhaps, but these categories seem a bit broad. If we had a specific made-up name for an interactive piece, project or feature then perhaps there would be more support for sharing and partaking in it because people will instantly understand what is offered. For instance, Neal Stephenson in The Diamond Age calls them “Ractives”.\r\n\r\nInteractivity and Personal Growth\r\n\r\nFrom a personal growth standpoint, we have been led by accountability concerns towards only being our “legal” self.  The opportunity to explore personas to interact with abandon has been greatly reduced and marginalized.  For instance, we are required by policy to be only ourselves on social media sites such as Facebook – any other personas are removed or at least viewed with suspicion. This is a shame.  There needs to be more opportunity to interact with imagination and passion – not just in second life or dating sites but in our average every day life. A site such as http://hipcats.com, allows you create personas and interact with others , making it possible to explore new ways of thinking and acting which may actually lead  to real life transformation.\r\n\r\nSlowing Down in Conclusion\r\n\r\nIt would be great if people slowed down a little and spent more time thinking and creating. The Internet is a wonderful medium to favour creative collaboration.  Perhaps exploring fresh personas would give people a better ambiance for creation and help tip the world back to a healthy balance.  If your character is an artist or inventor, then you might realize — hey… I can be an artist or inventor! Creative writing can often lead to self-transformation and even invention.\r\n\r\nI suspect that I am preaching to the converted.

It was the early 2000s that we got this ability in Flash and it was very exciting.  It is now very exciting in HTML where we can use free tools and publish just about everywhere.  We can also bring our experience to a very large creative community.', 'I have been making interactive media for twenty years and now I hope to convince you to try.  If you already code then I hope to convince you to try a new system.  ZIM.\r\n\r\nZIM Interactive Media JavaScript Modules\r\n\r\nIn 1995, I worked in Director to make CD Roms.  In 2000, I moved to Flash to make Web games and apps.  In 2015, I moved fully to HTML 5 and in particular the canvas and JavaScript to make anything.  http://danzen.com/museum/tour.html\r\n\r\nThe HTML canvas tag allows you to dynamically manipulate pixels to draw and animate shapes.  It was the early 2000s that we got this ability in Flash and it was very exciting.  It is now very exciting in HTML where we can use free tools and publish just about everywhere.  We can also bring our experience to a very large creative community.\r\n\r\nHTML HISTORICALLY\r\n\r\nHTML was initially conceived as a tagging language for showing people information in a Browser.  You could also provide information through forms with text fields, etc.  DHTML (dynamic HTML) came along in the 2000s and used iFrames and layers to show new information without reloading the page (as could JavaScript through AJAX).  Simple animation of page elements with JavaScript were introduced and continue on with libraries like jQuery.  CSS (cascading style sheets) came along to allow us to style the page more efficiently and completely.\r\n\r\nINTERACTIVE MEDIA\r\n\r\nWhile making Web pages for browsing does fall under the realm of interactive media, it can be more specifically called Web design.  Interactive media is much more – see the Interactivity Scale.  Interactive media allows us to create, communicate and play – not just consume.  To make interactive media takes more than just tagging or animating – you have to code (program).  This means capturing events and using logic to determine and create what comes next.  It means providing a variety of interfaces so people can create things (applications).  It means dragging, dropping, rotating and hit tests so people can re-enact the world but in a virtual space.  These are things that were not done in traditional Web design and development (aside from maybe dragging items into a shopping cart).\r\n\r\nDan Zen - Interactivity Scale\r\n\r\nZIM\r\n\r\nShort for Zen Interactive Modules, ZIM is a free JavaScript framework specifically for making Interactive Media. http://zimjs.com\r\n\r\nMuch of the ground work is found in a library called CreateJS written by Grant Skinner and crew.  Grant has transported years of interactive media knowledge with Flash to the HTML canvas / JavaScript world.\r\n\r\nRemember, the Flash community (and the Director community before hand) has spent over twenty years honing the commands needed to accomplish interactive media.  There are dozens and dozens of commands that go beyond traditional HTML and JavaScript.  These have been shifted and tweaked to perfection.  Without any one of these commands, we could not easily make what we make.  I know, I have created hundreds of applications with millions of lines of award winning code – trust me.  We all owe a HUGE debt to Grant and his team for the phenomenal job they have done preserving our heritage. – Dan Zen\r\n\r\nIn a sense, CreateJS lets us code in JavaScript as we did in Flash and has even added or simplified nicely in places.  The backbone of CreateJS is EaselJS which provides us with proper object oriented display hierarchy – we can nest objects within objects (containers, shapes, bitmaps, text) and manipulate properties such as position, rotation, alpha, scale and these properties are transferred to their children.  So CreateJS takes us roughly to ground zero of Flash.\r\n\r\nEnter ZIM.  When I was coding in Flash, I made over one hundred helper classes (a class is a bunch of code that does something and we can use it over and over).  These were created over ten years and put into packages but otherwise were a touch hodgepodge.  This time, I got to start fresh and planned from the start to let others use and understand these classes.  Half of them are now in ZIM version 1.  The other half, which are for advanced interfaces like gesture and multiuser will be launched as ZIM version 2.  Certainly, there is a lot that can be done with ZIM version 1.\r\n\r\nzim1.2\r\n\r\nUSING ZIM\r\n\r\nYou can code with any text editor but it is best if you have syntax coloring so you can see the different parts of the code.  Sublime, TextPad, NotePad++, DreamWeaver, etc.\r\n\r\nStart with a ZIM Template – perhaps the basic template.  Copy the source code into a file and name it sample.html.  Now drop the file onto a Web browser – Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari.  You should see a big button and if you click it, it will go to ZIMjs.  Look at the code and see if you can make sense of it.\r\n\r\nOn ZIMjs, there is information about the functions and classes that are available.  There is example code and you can try out the examples.  There is also a Docs section that tells you what is available, what parameters you can provide, and what properties, methods and events are available.\r\n\r\nZIMjs Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can start cutting and pasting bits of the examples at a time into your sample.html and see if you can make things work.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to know how CreateJS works so you can draw circles, rectangles, lines, and use bitmaps (images), sound and animation.  You can use tutorials, etc.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to know JavaScript for the programming logic parts such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, arrays and objects.  Also basic number and string manipulations.  Eventually, you will want to make your own classes as well.\r\n\r\nRead about coding here: Dan Zen Museum Coding Tour.\r\n\r\ntour\r\n\r\nPlease try out ZIM and if you need a hand, there is the CreateJS Facebook Group where we answer questions about CreateJS and ZIM.\r\n\r\nI can tell you now, you are as close as you have ever come to making being able to make interactive media.  You need no huge application, no instals, etc.  And you can package your code up into a mobile app in less than an hour once you know what you are doing – all free (aside from the $100 dev cost on Apple, the $25 dev cost on Android and $20 for Windows – free for BB).  Just copy that template file and start poking around.\r\n\r\nIf you want formal training, I teach at Sheridan College in the one-year post grad diploma program http://imm.sheridanc.on.ca – we have a great learning environment.

(7, 'Donna Morris', 3, 'Future-Proof Your Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence', 'AI and machine learning (ML) are changing our way of life in more ways than the invention of the PC, the rise of the internet, or the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets. It’s exciting to see how AI has the potential to take away the mundane tasks associated with our lives and jobs, as well as its potential to boost productivity and create entirely new industries. But it’s also a huge shift, and can cause some uneasiness when we think about the future of the workplace.', 'A day doesn’t go by without another prediction that highlights the influence of technology on jobs. Experts at McKinsey predict that as many as 70 million jobs in the U.S. could be impacted by automation by 2030; in contrast, Gartner reports that artificial intelligence (AI) may create more jobs than it eliminates. One thing is certain: we are in a period of unprecedented change, and these stats are enough to give anyone pause about the long-term relevance of their skills and abilities.\r\n\r\nAI and machine learning (ML) are changing our way of life in more ways than the invention of the PC, the rise of the internet, or the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets. It’s exciting to see how AI has the potential to take away the mundane tasks associated with our lives and jobs, as well as its potential to boost productivity and create entirely new industries. But it’s also a huge shift, and can cause some uneasiness when we think about the future of the workplace.\r\n\r\nDoes the rise of AI mean we’re preparing for a future of mass joblessness? Simply put, no.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with this reality: AI will make us more efficient, but the workplace still very much values the human touch. In fact, according to an Adobe study, 70 percent of American office workers believe that face-to-face contact is required to do their jobs well. Almost 80 percent believe that the successful workers of the future will excel at collaboration. We all have the opportunity to continue to hone our uniquely human skillsets that machines will not demonstrate.\r\n\r\nWhether you are still in school, making your way through a degree, or have decades of experience in the workplace, here are three areas to develop to remain relevant in an emerging AI workplace and world:\r\n\r\nEmotional Intelligence: When we talk about uniquely human skillsets, EQ or emotional quotient, also referred to as emotional intelligence, is the pinnacle. Howard Gardner, the influential Harvard theorist, defines EQ as the level of your ability to understand other people, what motivates them, and how to work cooperatively with them.\r\nMore than ever before, EQ is being recognized as equally or more valuable than IQ to long-term success. People ultimately want to interact — they do not want to follow a machine, literally or figuratively. Across businesses and industries, we need people with a high EQ at all levels within organizations.\r\n\r\n2. Creative problem-solving: Redefining problems and opportunities, coming up with new approaches, and taking action are key characteristics of creative problem-solving. Unlike tech trends that come and go, problem-solving skills are always relevant. Adobe surveyed 2,000 educators and education policymakers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan, and 86 percent of those surveyed said they believe that students who excel at creative problem-solving will have opportunities for higher-earning jobs in the future. Seventy-five percent predicted that professions requiring creative problem-solving are less likely to be impacted by automation. Beyond problem-solving, creativity itself is another distinctly human trait that will continue to benefit you in the short and long-term.\r\n\r\n3. Curiosity and flexibility: With the pace of change in the workplace, employees who continue to challenge themselves to learn new skills and techniques — those who continue to push the leading edge of their expertise — have a competitive advantage. These individuals are open to breaking out of their comfort zones and trying completely new areas. Curiosity and flexibility have always been important, but in the age of AI they are exponentially more critical. As businesses experiment with the benefits of AI, employees need to be on a constant quest to deliver a higher level of value.\r\n\r\nAutomation and AI will change the nature of many jobs — AND create many new opportunities. While some of the best jobs of the future simply don’t yet exist, the need for these uniquely human skills will remain important to job growth and stability for years to come. Ongoing education, exposure to different cultures, developing and maintaining a diverse network of peers, and proactively seeking out feedback will allow you to hone your uniquely human skills that no machine can match. Regardless of how AI may or may not impact the workplace, demonstrating emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and the ability to adapt will serve you well for building a long, prosperous career.', 0, 'technical2.jpeg', 'https://theblog.adobe.com/future-proof-career-age-artificial-intelligence/'),
